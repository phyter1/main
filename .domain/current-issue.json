  "body": "Retitle my position to tech lead, which is more semantically correct, and add emphasis on AI first development and creating teams that not only include humans, but also agents update all of the pages to reflect this. Also, use the principles page to as a guide to update the rest of the pages as well. There should probably be a skill section for agentic AI creation and leadership. The projects page can be left alone.",
